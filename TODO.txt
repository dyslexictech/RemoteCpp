- Implement refresh current (for files and file lists).
- Implement refresh all (for files and file lists).
- Implement singleton Grep.
- Implement fast file open (with selection box).
- Index properly the possible ToggleFiles at ListFiles time.
- Use the file index to also follow includes.
- When displaying files from the index, display the quick option box when there are multiple options.
- Improve error handling to always notify the user when the remote connection is broken.
- Index in a dict() the lookups for the toggle files.
- Command to refresh current open file.
- When a file is renamed update directly the file list to match.
- Fix the internal state so the file list is indexed to the 'cwd'
- OnRefresh, if the RemoteFile is different from the local one notify the user and ask them if they want to proceed.
- Toggling Header/Implementation from 'c' or 'cpp' should go directly to 'h' without prompt.
